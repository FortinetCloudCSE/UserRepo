### Task 2 - Push your content to GitHubo repo

Finally, **from your local workstation CLI**, push the newly created Hugo site up to GitHub to automatically publish your Hugo Site

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "<my commit message>"
   git push 
   ``` 

- Remember we're always working in a Git Branch, so we'll need to issue a Pull request and merge [using this procedure](gittips.html)
